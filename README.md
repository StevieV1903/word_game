myJoke Generator is a fully responsive reactjs SPA that makes a fetch to an external api and renders the joke on the click of a button and also requires the user to click a seperate button to reveal the punchline. Also includes some pretty awesome button animations.

This responsive project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

The application is hosted on AWS Amplify.
