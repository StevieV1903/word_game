# [Hangman](https://main.dcr5s95bldpus.amplifyapp.com/)

Based around the hangman game, the application carries out various fetches across multiple API's allowing the user to choose from 10 categories and each game within the category has a hint button with, dependent on which category, either a picture clue or a relevant written clue to help with the puzzle.

This responsive project was developed by Steve Vance, Chris Fraser and James Fraser and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

The application is hosted on AWS Amplify.
